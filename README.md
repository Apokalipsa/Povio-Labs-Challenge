This is a sample project that I did for Povio Labs.
I used the following technologies: HTML5, CSS3, javaScript, jQuery and google API.

Purpose:
Demonstration of front end development implementation

Application assumptions: 

Following a preexisting design, the application in question is a sort of social network for the travel enthusiasts.
The main page consists of a custom map with markers showing the location of people on the network, by default in the demo there is a left panel that has detail information and options connected to one of the users on the map.

By the clicking on the close icon in the left panel, the map is expanded to full width.
On the map, the pulsing marker demonstrates how the left panel is opened by clicking the marker. The location icon when clicked shows you current location.

There are two additional pages which aim demonstrate a style consistency.
One of them is a login page.The second one is a chat page simulation, using handlebars.js templating implementation.
